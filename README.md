# Lending Club Case Study

The primary objective of the Lending Club case study is to mitigate the credit loss while approving or denying the loans to their customers. 
This challenge arises from two potential scenarios
1. Rejecting the loans to the applicants who has the capability to repay the loans will result in a loss of business to the company
2. Approving the loans to the customers who are likely to default may lead to financial loss for the company

The objective is to determine the applicants at risk of defaulting on loans, enabling a reduction in credit losses. This case study aims to achieve this goal through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using the provided dataset.
